<br>
The purpose of this guide is to walk through the process of creating a simple Node.js app that retrieves messages in Office 365 or Outlook.com. The source code in this repository is what you should end up with if you follow the steps outlined here.
This guide will use the Microsoft Graph to access Outlook mail. Microsoft recommends using the Microsoft Graph to access Outlook mail, calendar, and contacts. You should use the Outlook APIs directly (via https://outlook.office.com/api) only if you require a feature that is not available on the Graph endpoints. For a version of this sample that uses the Outlook APIs, see this branch.+
This guide assumes that you already have Node.js installed and working on your development machine.
